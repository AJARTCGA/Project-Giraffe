# Project-Giraffe
Group Project for ETGG 2802 Computer Graphics 2 (Sophomore Level)
The project is designed to let us practice graphics techniques in OpenGL while showing them off in a simple game. 
For the end goal, the player will control multiple animals, and they have to aim the animals and send them running in order to either escape or defeat the hordes of zombies.
